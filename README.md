# EARLY

EARLY is a DAO for longevity practitioners that allows members to write posts to share across the community. It pulls data from wearables such as Oura, Apple Health, and Levels. Think of it like a lightweight internal blog. Features include a simple **Markdown-based** editor with preview, **image drag and drop**, comments and likes, **search**, a clean responsive layout with **dark mode support**, and an admin role for hiding posts.
